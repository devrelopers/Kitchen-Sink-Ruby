# KitchenSink.rb - Comprehensive Ruby Examples

A complete demonstration of Ruby language features, idioms, and best practices in a single file.

## Overview

`KitchenSink.rb` is an educational resource that showcases virtually every Ruby language feature with idiomatic examples. This file serves as both a reference guide and a learning tool for Ruby developers of all levels.

## Features Demonstrated

### Core Language Features
- **Data Types**: Integers, Floats, Strings, Symbols, Booleans, nil, Ranges, Regular Expressions
- **Collections**: Arrays, Hashes, Sets, and their various initialization methods
- **Variables**: Local, instance, class, global variables, and constants
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, assignment, splat, and safe navigation

### Control Structures
- **Conditionals**: if/elsif/else, unless, ternary operator, case statements
- **Pattern Matching**: Ruby 2.7+ pattern matching syntax
- **Loops**: while, until, for, loop with break/next, times, each

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes**: Constructors, instance/class methods, attributes, visibility modifiers
- **Inheritance**: Single inheritance, method overriding, super
- **Modules**: Mixins (include), class methods (extend), prepend, module functions
- **Structs**: Basic and keyword-initialized structs with custom methods

### Functional Programming
- **Blocks**: Single-line and multi-line blocks
- **Procs and Lambdas**: Creation, calling conventions, currying
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Function composition, partial application
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Infinite sequences and lazy enumerators

### Advanced Features
- **Metaprogramming**: define_method, method_missing, class_eval, instance_eval
- **Reflection**: Object introspection, method objects, constant manipulation
- **Refinements**: Scoped monkey patching for safer extensions
- **Operator Overloading**: Custom operators for user-defined classes

### Enumerable Methods
Comprehensive examples of:
- map, select, reject, reduce, find
- any?, all?, none?, one?
- partition, group_by, sort_by
- zip, cycle, take, drop
- Lazy evaluation chains

### I/O and File Operations
- **File I/O**: Reading, writing, file operations with blocks
- **Directory Operations**: Navigation, listing, globbing
- **JSON/YAML**: Parsing and generation
- **Command Line**: ARGV processing, OptionParser

### Exception Handling
- **Basic Handling**: begin/rescue/else/ensure blocks
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating custom error classes
- **Control Flow**: throw/catch, retry mechanisms

### Concurrency
- **Threads**: Basic threads, thread synchronization with Mutex
- **Fibers**: Lightweight concurrency, generators
- **Thread-Local Storage**: Thread-specific variables

### System Integration
- **Environment Variables**: Reading and setting ENV
- **Process Management**: Command line arguments, system interaction
- **Benchmarking**: Performance measurement and comparison
- **Garbage Collection**: GC control and statistics

## Usage

### Running the File
```bash
ruby KitchenSink.rb
```
